# FreeRTOS RX Family IoT Reference

## Introduction

This product provides the reference of IoT solution with using [RX family](https://www.renesas.com/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rx-32-bit-performance-efficiency-mcus), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), and [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS.html). The RX family is a kind of MCUs provided by the [Renesas](https://www.renesas.com).
You can easily try to run AWS IoT demos using RX family while working with our various other products.
Refer to the [Getting Started Guide](Getting_Started_Guide.md) for step by step instructions on setting up your development environment and running demos.

### Data Flash Usage

| Area | Description | Contents |Start address<br>[Size] | Section name |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
|LittleFS management area|It's consist of the filesystem LittleFS,<br>default size is 8960 bytes.<br>You can change size by `LFS_FLASH_BLOCK_COUNT`.|IoT const data<br><ul><li>thingname</li><li>endpoint</li><li>claim credentials</li><li>device credentials</li><li>provisioning template</li><li>codesigncert</li><li>root ca</li></ul>|0x00100000<br><br>[8960 bytes<br>(*Default*)]|C_LITTLEFS_MANAGEMENT_AREA|
|Free area|It's not used by the demo.<br>Therefore, it's free area for user application.|User application data|0x00102300<br>(*Default*)<br><br>[23808 bytes<br>(*Default*)]|C_USER_APPLICATION_AREA|

* LittleFS management area
  * The demo project uses a maximum of 8960 bytes of Data Flash from address 0x00100000 to 0x001022FF using LittleFS.
    * If this area is less than 8960 bytes, the demo will not work properly.
  * You must **NOT** overwrite IoT const data in this area.
  * If you intend to read/write user application data in this area, increase the value of `LFS_FLASH_BLOCK_COUNT` in the "Projects\\...\\frtos_config\\rm_littlefs_flash_config.h".
    * `LFS_FLASH_BLOCK_COUNT` must be specified 71 ( == 9088 bytes) or more and 256 (32768 bytes, it is Data Flash size) or less.
    * You must use LittleFS's API to read/write this area.
* Free area
  * The remaining area on Data Flash, 23808 bytes of Data Flash area at address 0x00102300 or above, can be used as user application area.
    * you must use FLASH FIT module's API to read/write this area.

#### Data Flash Memory Map

The following figure indicates how memory in Data Flash in CK-RX65N is used for each example of `LFS_FLASH_BLOCK_COUNT` value.

```text
In case of `LFS_FLASH_BLOCK_COUNT` == 70 (8960 bytes)
 +----------------------------+-------------------------+ <- 0x00100000
 |  LittleFS management area  |  IoT const data         |    <8960 bytes>
 +----------------------------+-------------------------+ <- 0x00102300
 |  Free area                 |  User application data  |    <23808 bytes>
 |                            |                         |
 +----------------------------+-------------------------+ <- 0x00107FFF

In case of `LFS_FLASH_BLOCK_COUNT` == 170 (21760 bytes)
 +----------------------------+-------------------------+ <- 0x00100000
 |  LittleFS management area  |  IoT const data         |    <21760 bytes>
 |                            |  User application data  |
 +----------------------------+-------------------------+ <- 0x00105500
 |  Free area                 |  User application data  |    <11008 bytes>
 +----------------------------+-------------------------+ <- 0x00107FFF
```

## Limitation

* OTA update is not supported.
* ROM/RAM size is not optimized.
* CLI task cannot run after starting the demo to avoid the SCI conflict.
* The project generation feature on e2 studio can not be supported.

### Fixed configuration values of FIT Modules

* There are some config values of FIT Modules that cannot be changed in order for the program to work properly.
* The config values of the following FIT Modules of tables cannot be changed.
* If changed, the program may not work properly.
